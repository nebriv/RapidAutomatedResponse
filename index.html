<p>Rapid Automated Response (RAR) is a combination of <a href="http://snort.org">Snort IDS</a> and <a href="https://code.google.com/p/grr/">Google's GRR Rapid Response</a> to provide a utilty that will automatically collect and manage data collected from remote clients when a breach occurs. The idea is to replicate the process and results of commercially available software, wihtout reinventing the wheel and starting from the ground up. This project was created by <a href="http://benvirgilio.com">Ben Virgilio</a> while attending Champlain College's Computer Networking and Information Security (CNIS) major.</p>

<p>RAR is client server system that monitors for alerts from (currently, but hopefully will be expanded) Snort IDS. These alerts are then passed on to a server which will interface with GRR and run flows (requests for information, searches, data dumps) on clients based on XML rules associated with the Snort alert. The information is can then either be retrieved manually from the GRR consoles or be extracted out to the file system for further analysis.</p>

<p>The purpose of this project is understand how Intrusion Detection Systems and distributed forensics can be incorporated to reduce the amount of time and work required to handle an incident. This could reduce the overall response time to hours instead of days, as well as completely remove the need to extract an active client system from the network for further analysis.</p>

<p>This project is not sponsored by either Snort or Google and is currently very early in development.</p>

<p>This project is not currently ready to be "installed" on a network as it is still undergoing core development. In the future a installer script will be available to download.</p>

<p>The first steps are to complete the XML parsing functionality of the server code and to ensure it can make the appropriate API calls. This should provide a completely functioning product albeit relatively simple. The next step would be to work on parsing different types of logs from various alerting systems, this will provide RAR with more data to work with and respond to. From there creating a SIEM (Security Incident and Event Management) system to keep track of the alerts and the resulting information would be helpful.</p>

<p>Further development on encrypting data sent to the RAR server and to ensure the client and server are properly talking will need to be done, however this is not part of the core functionality and not necessary to have a fully functioning product. And of course staying current with the development of GRR will be vital throughout the entire process of this project as they are continually adding features and fixing issues with GRR.</p>
